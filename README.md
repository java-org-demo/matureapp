# Mature App (Different Branching)

The "mature" application depends on "downstreamapp".  The primary difference
between this application and the others is that this one uses Github Flow, aka
feature branches, which is often found on applications that are more mature,
have automated testing and so on.

We use this repo to show how even if you are releasing via two channels, the
branching strategy can be completely different between repositories.
